# CA1 - SIMD Introduction

## The first program (1.cpp)
This program simply prints out the CPU info, and the SIMD architectures supported by the CPU.

## The second program (2.cpp)
This program prints out the different integer representations of a 128-bit register (unsigned 8-bit, signed 8-bit, unsigned 16-bit and ...) along with its single precision floating point representation (four 32-bit SPFP numbers).
