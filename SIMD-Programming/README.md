# CA2 - SIMD Programming

# The first program (1.cpp)
This program creates a random array of 2^20 single-precision floating point numbers, and tries to find the maximum element's value and index using both serial and parallel (SIMD) approaches, and compares the results, calculating the speedup.

# The second program (2.cpp)
This program creates a random array of 2^20 single-precision floating point numbers, and calculates the mean and standard deviation of these numbers using both serial and parallel (SIMD) approaches, and compares the results, calculating the speedup.
